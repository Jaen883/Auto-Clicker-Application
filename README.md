Windows Auto Clicker Application 😃

The Windows Auto Clicker Application, created using Python and compiled for the Windows operating system, allows you to automate mouse clicks and simulate repetitive actions. 

With adjustable click intervals, this application is particularly useful for automating tasks in gaming, form filling, and software testing scenarios. 

While using automation tools, it's important to adhere to legal and ethical guidelines, and to comply with the terms and conditions of the software or service you are interacting with. 

Please note that the effectiveness and compatibility of the application may vary based on factors such as the target software, system configurations, and security measures in place. It is recommended to test the application in your specific environment, which in this case was Windows 11.
